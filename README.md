Project name: Internships2022SQL
This project was created for an assignment given in Advance Java (instructor Jeanine Rioux). 
This project was submitted May 20th, 2022. 
Description of project: Was to utilize SQLite (via replit) to develop a database of internships. This database was ordered by the date the internships were posted and alphabetically, both in ascending order. Additionally it was also sorted out by which internships are paying and which ones offer insurance. 
Thank you Google for showing me blogs and articles on the usages of SQL and basic queries.
